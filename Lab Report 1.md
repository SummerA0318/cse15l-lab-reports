Step 1: download VS Code:

People can download the app from https://code.visualstudio.com/. Since I have previously downloaded it, I have a screenshot of my previous codes.

Step 2: Remote connecting

I followed this tutorial [TUTORIAL] How to Reset your Password to change my password first with chrome. Then I login to my remote account with my new password.

Step 3: run commands

I tried several commands and understand what they do.

Pwd: shows you the current directory youâ€™re in

Ls: shows all files in the current directory

Ls -a: shows all files including the hidden ones in the current directory

Cd: change directory to somewhere I need

Step 4: 

First I create a WhereAmI.java file, save it and run it on my local computer then use scp command to copy it onto my remote computer. Then I login to my remote account and save and run the WhereAmI file. I found that the os.name, username, user home and user directory of local computer and remote computer are all different which shows that I am really on two different computers with two different accounts. It seems that getProperty is a built-in function that can get some basic information for the computer and account.

The process takes me 1 minute 40 seconds. If I do it 100 times, I would spend about 2 hours and a half.

Step 5:

This time the process takes me 1 minute 10 seconds. I save half a minute on the same process!

Step 6:

This time I spent 3 seconds running these commands together.
